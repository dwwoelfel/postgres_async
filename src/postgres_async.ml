(* There are a couple of invariants we need to be careful of:

   - changes to [t.state] need simultaneous ivar filling and/or reader & writer closing.
   - [t.state = Open _] must imply [t.reader] is not closed

   Further, we need to be careful to catch synchronous writer exceptions and write flush
   messages to postgres.

   We try and make sure these invariants hold by making some of the fields in [t] opaque
   to stuff outside of this small module, so that by reading the short [module T] we can
   be confident the whole module handles this correctly.

  (* [Reader.read_one_iobuf_at_a_time] hands us 'chunks' to [handle_chunk]. A chunk is
     an iobuf, where the window of the iobuf is set to the data that has been pulled from
     the OS into the [Reader.t] but not yet consumed by the application. Said window
     'chunk' contains messages, potentially a partial message at the end in case e.g.
     the bytes of a message is split across two calls to the [read] syscall.

     Suppose the server has send us three 5-byte messages, "AAAAA", "BBBBB" and "CCCCC".
     Each message has a 5-byte header (containing its type and length), represented by
     'h'. Suppose further that the OS handed us 23 bytes when [Reader.t] called [read].

     {v
        0 bytes   10 bytes  20 bytes
        |         |         |
        hhhhhAAAAAhhhhhBBBBBhhh
       /--------window---------\
     v}

     We want to give each message to [handle_message], one at a time. So, first we must
     move the window on the iobuf so that it contains precisely the first message's
     payload, i.e., the bytes 'AAAAA', i.e., this iobuf but with the window set to [5,10).
     [Protocol.Backend.focus_on_message] does this by consuming the header 'hhhhh' to
     learn the type and length (thereby moving the window lo-bound up) and then resizing
     it (moving the hi-bound down) like so:

     {v
        hhhhhAAAAAhhhhhBBBBBhhh
            /-wdw-\
     v}

     Now we can call [handle_message] with this iobuf.

     The contract we have with [handle_message] is that it will use calls to functions in
     [Iobuf.Consume] to consume the bytes inside the window we set, that is, consume the
     entire message. As it consumes bytes of the message, the window lo-bound is moved up,
     so when it's done consuming the window is [10,10)

     {v
        hhhhhAAAAAhhhhhBBBBBhhh
                 /\
     v}

     and then [bounded_flip_hi] sets the window to [10,23) (since we remembered '23' in
     [chunk_hi_bound]).

     {v
        hhhhhAAAAAhhhhhBBBBBhhh
                 /-----window--\
     v}

     then, we recurse (focus on [15,20), call [handle_message], etc.), and recurse again.

     At this point, reading the 'message length' field tells us that we only have part of
     'C' in our buffer (three out of 5+5 bytes). So, we return from [handle_chunk]. The
     contract we have with [Reader.t] is that we will leave in the iobuf the data that we
     did not consume. It looks at the iobuf window to understand what's left, keeps only
     those three bytes of 'C' in its internal buffer, and uses [read] to refill the buffer
     before calling us again; hopefully at that point we'll have the whole of message 'C'.

     For this to work it is important that [handle_message] actually consumed the whole
     message, and did not move the window hi-bound. We _could_ save those bounds and
     forcibly restore them before doing the flip, however we prefer to instead just check
     that [handle_message] did this because the functions that parse messages are written
     to 'consume' them anyway, and checking that they actually did so is a good validation
     that we correctly understand and are thinking about all fields in the postgres
     protocol; not consuming all the bytes of the message indicates a potential parsing
     bug. That's what [check_window_after_handle_message] does.

     Note the check against [max_message_length]. Without it, if postgres told us that it
     was sending us an extremely long message, we'd return from [handle_chunk] constantly
     asking for refills, always thinking we needed more data and consuming all the RAM.
     Instead, we will just bail out rather than asking for refills if a message gets too
     long. The limit is arbitrary, but ought to be enough for anybody (with an environment
     variable escape hatch if we turn out to be wrong). *)

(* So there are a few different ways one could imagine handling asynchronous messages, and
   it basically breaks down to whether or not you have a single background job pulling
   messages out of the reader, filtering away asynchronous messages, and putting the
   remainder somewhere that request-response functions can pull them out of, or you have
   some way of synchronising access to the reader and noticing if it lights up while no
   request-response function is running.

   We've gone for the latter, basically because efficiently handing messages from the
   background to request-response functions is painful, and it puts a lot of complicated
   state into [t] (the background job can't be separate, because it needs to know whether
   or not [t.sequencer] is in use in order to classify an [ErrorResponse] as part of
   request-response or as asynchronous).

   The tradeoff is that we need a custom [Query_sequencer] module for the [when_idle]
   function (though at least that can be a separate, isolated module), and we need to use
   the fairly low level [interruptible_ready_to] on the [Reader]'s fd (which is skethcy).
   All in, I think this turns out to be simpler, and it also isolates the features that
   add async message support from the rest of the library. *)

(* We use the extended query protocol rather than the simple query protocol
   because it provides support for [parameters] (via the 'bind' message), and
   because it guarantees that only a SQL statement is executed per query, which
   simplifies the state machine we need to use to handle the responses
   significantly.

   We don't currently take advantage of named statements or portals, we just
   use the 'unnamed' ones. We don't take advantage of the ability to bind a
   statement twice or partially execute a portal; we just send the full
   parse-bind-describe-execute sequence unconditionally in one go.

   Ultimately, one needs to read the "message flow/extended query" section of
   the documentation:

   https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/protocol-flow.html#PROTOCOL-FLOW-EXT-QUERY

   What follows is a brief summary, and then a description of how the different
   functions fit in.

   When any error occurs, the server will report the error and tehen discard
   messages until a 'sync' message. This means that we can safely send
   parse-bind-describe-execute in one go and then read all the responses,
   because if one step fails the remainder will be ignored. So, we do this
   because it improves latency.

   [parse_and_start_executing_query] instructs the server to parse the query,
   bind the parameters, describe the type of the rows that will be produced.
   It then reads response messages, walking through a state machine. The first
   three states are easy, because we expect either the relevant response
   messages (ParseComplete, BindComplete, RowDescription|NoData), or an
   ErrorResponse.

   After that, things are trickier. We don't know what string was in the query
   and whether or not the query emits no data (e.g., a DELETE), or if server is
   going to send us rows, or if it's going to try and COPY IN/OUT, etc.

   [parse_and_start_executing_query] detects which case we're in and returns a
   value of type [setup_loop_result] indicating this. It's a little weird
   because we don't want to consume any of the actual data (if applicable) in
   that funciton, just detect the mode.

   If the response to the [Describe] message was a [RowDescription], we know
   that the response to the [Execute] will be some [DataRow]s, so we don't look
   at any messages after that (i.e., in that case we don't look at the response
   to [Execute] in this function).

   However if the response to [Describe] was [NoData], then we _have_ to look at
   the first message in response to the [Execute] message to know which case
   we're in. _Fortunately_, the first message in all the other cases does not
   actually contain any data, so we can do what we want (detect mode and return).

   Here they are:

   - [About_to_deliver_rows] e.g., a SELECT. We know we're in this case iff the
     response to our [Describe] message was a [RowDescription], and we don't look
     at the response to the [Execute] message; the caller is responsible for
     consuming the [DataRow]s.
   - [About_to_copy_out] i.e., COPY ... TO STDOUT. We're here iff we get a
     [CopyOutResponse] in response to our [Execute].
   - [Ready_to_copy_in] i.e., COPY ... FROM STDIN. We're here iff we get a
     [CopyInResponse]. We return, and the caller is responsible for sending
     a load of [CopyData] messages etc.
   - [EmptyQuery] i.e., the query was the empty string. We're here if we get
     a [EmptyQueryResponse], at which point we're done (and can sync); we do not
     expect a [CommandComplete].
   - [Command_complete_without_output], e.g. a DELETE. We're here if we just get
     [CommandComplete] straight away.

   Note that it's also possible for the [About_to_deliver_rows] case to complete
   without output. The difference is that one corresponds to receiving
   [RowDescription], [CommandComplete] and the other [NoData], [CommandComplete]. *)
